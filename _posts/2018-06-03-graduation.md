My graduation was on the 1st of June.
I have now finally graduated with Vocational Qualification in Business and Information Technology and it feels great.

Lots of my classmates went back to their home cities, some of which are far away but we'll still keep in touch with some of them.
Some got work immediately after graduation or actually a little before it, but most of us did *not*, but it can't be helped really at this point.
We just need to try to get work and/or to get into other places to study at, like universities.

I'll most likely update my situation on here, and might also post some I.T related content at some point in the near future.
