I have received the information that I did not get into any universities though the studyinfo joint-applications,
so now I'm trying though the open-application to get into Turku's University of Applied Sciences.

I should hear back in a few weeks time, so let's hope that I do get in though that.

I attended the Assembly Summer 2018 event last weekend and it was fun while it lasted, I got to test HTC Vive (VR-headset) which was interesting as
I had only used Oculus Rift before and I can say that Vive is much better than Oculus. I even got addicted to a game called Beat Saber, so now I would want to get myself one.
Unfortunately, currently I couldn't even use it in my room even if I had it due to it's space requirements and system plus it's price tag. I need to go to a place where I could play with it.
